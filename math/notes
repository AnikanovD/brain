Example

```
// Fields

R (one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, plus, minus, equal, unknown)
A (digit, operator, expression)
E (unsolved > solved)
T (position)

// Relations many-to-one
(one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve) : (digit)
(plus, minus, equal) : (operator)
(digit, operator, equal) : (expression)

// Relations
T+expression : (digit > operator > digit)
T+solved : (expression > +expression) > (solved)
E+ : (* > equal)


// motivation
(digit > operator > digit > equal) > (solve)
(digit > operator > digit > equal > digit) > (solved, unsolved)

// training
(one > plus > two > equal > three) = (solved)
(one > plus > four > equal > five) = (solved)
(two > plus > three > equal > five) = (solved)
(two > plus > five > equal > seven) = (solved)
(six > plus > one > equal > )
